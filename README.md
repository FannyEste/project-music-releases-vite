# Music Releases

This week we worked with React creating componets that gets data from Spotify
to transfer to its children's components using props, the requirements were to create components, displays album cover and name, and artist name, adding hover effects and icons, and make the names and albums linkables by clic on the names and it directs you to an external URL.

### The Problem

I used Node.js and npm to set up the development environment. The first step in building the Spotify mockup was installing the necessary packages via npm. 

There it was plenty of challenges, like with Node not recognizing the modules. I fixed these issues by reinstalling packages and ensuring the correct file paths. 

Since React helps in building user interfaces by breaking down web pages into smaller, reusable components, it helped me break down the music releases page into smaller parts like individual Album and ArtistName, etc. Instead of building one long HTML file, I made reusable components that dynamically change based on the data.

I got good help from blogs, stackoverflow (specially the section for this project) and chat gpt.

If I had more time I would like to continue with the strech-goal.json (side bar/API)
